This is an implementation of a `try-let` similar to the one proposed in
[RFC #1303](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1303), as a proc macro.

> _NOTE:_ Proc macros in statement position are currently unstable, meaning this
> macro will not work on stable rust until
> [PR #68717](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68717) is merged.

See the documentation for more details.
